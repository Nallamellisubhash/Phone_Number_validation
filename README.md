This will check weather the number is valid or invalid
Phone number validation is the process of verifying if a given phone number is accurate, formatted correctly, and capable of receiving calls or messages. This is essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of contact information in various applications, such as user registrations, marketing campaigns, and customer service operations. Here are key aspects of phone number validation:

1. Format Verification
International Format: Ensuring the phone number is in the correct international format, which usually starts with a '+' followed by the country code and then the subscriber number.
Local Format: Checking if the phone number adheres to the local formatting rules, which can vary significantly between countries.
2. Length Check
Phone numbers should be checked for appropriate length, which varies by country and region. For example, a US phone number typically has 10 digits, excluding the country code.
3. Country Code Validation
Validating that the country code is correct and matches the intended country. This involves cross-referencing with a list of valid country codes.
4. Area Code Validation
For regions where area codes are used, ensuring the area code is valid and corresponds to a real geographic area or mobile network.
5. Prefix and Number Range
Checking if the number starts with a valid prefix and falls within the valid range for the specified country or region.
6. Special Characters and Spaces
Ensuring that the number contains only valid characters (digits, plus signs, parentheses, dashes) and that any special characters are correctly placed.
7. Carrier and Line Type Identification
Identifying the carrier associated with the phone number and determining if it is a mobile, landline, or VoIP number. Some validation services can also identify toll-free numbers.
8. Liveness Check
Sending a verification message or call to ensure the number is active and capable of receiving messages or calls. This step can help filter out disconnected or fake numbers.
9. Regular Expressions
Using regular expressions (regex) to programmatically verify the format of phone numbers. Different regex patterns can be designed to match the rules of various countries.
10. External Services and APIs
Utilizing third-party services and APIs that specialize in phone number validation to handle complex validations, including carrier lookup, real-time verification, and compliance with country-specific rules.
